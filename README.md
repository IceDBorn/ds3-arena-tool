# //// Intro ////

Isn't it hard to get the gold badge at the arena? Especially, when you lose because of lag or broken builds?
So how about using this tool to backup your wins, restoring your latest win after a loss (which means that you revert any loss) and
keeping track of them!

# //// How to use ////

1. Press the Backup button or F9  to backup the save folder with your latest win.

2. Press the Restore button or F10 to ovewrite your current save folder with the
   save folder you backed-up the last time you pressed the Backup button or F9.

3. Press the Edit Wins button to edit the number of your wins.


# //// Notes ////

1. Editing the number of your wins does not change your wins in-game, it's just a way to keep track of them.
2. Press the Backup Button or F9 when you arrive to firelink shrine after a win.
3. Pressing the Backup button or F9 will increase your wins counter by 1, so make sure to only backup after a win.   
4. Make sure that you press the Restore button or F10 after a loss while you are at the main menu and not loaded in your
   character because the game will overwrite the restored save with the current save.
5. If the tool exits for no reason, there's probably a problem with the wins.txt file located inside the tool's folder or there
   might be a problem with your antivirus.
